## Performance by City Size

Expected performance metrics based on data volume:

### Small City (<1,000 mentions)

- Places indexed: 500-1,500
- Mentions: 200-1,000
- MV rows: 100-300
- P95 search latency: <50ms
- MV refresh time: <10 seconds
- Aggregation compute time: <30 seconds

### Medium City (1,000-10,000 mentions)

**Example: Portland**
- Places indexed: 1,500-4,000
- Mentions: 1,000-10,000
- MV rows: 300-1,000
- P95 search latency: <100ms
- MV refresh time: <30 seconds
- Aggregation compute time: 1-3 minutes

### Large City (10,000-100,000 mentions)

**Expected: New York City, San Francisco, Los Angeles**
- Places indexed: 4,000-15,000
- Mentions: 10,000-100,000
- MV rows: 1,000-5,000
- P95 search latency: <150ms (may require index tuning)
- MV refresh time: <60 seconds
- Aggregation compute time: 5-15 minutes

### Very Large City (>100,000 mentions)

**Future optimization required**
- Places indexed: >15,000
- Mentions: >100,000
- MV rows: >5,000
- P95 search latency: <200ms (requires partitioning)
- MV refresh time: <120 seconds
- Aggregation compute time: 15-30 minutes

## Index Performance

### Covering Indexes

Current indexes provide index-only scans for common queries:

```sql
-- Iconic covering index
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_iconic_city_rank_covering
ON mv_top_iconic_by_city (city_id, rank)
INCLUDE (place_id, name, cuisine, lat, lon, address,
         iconic_score, unique_threads, total_mentions, last_seen);

-- Trending covering index
CREATE INDEX idx_mv_trending_city_rank_covering
ON mv_top_trending_by_city (city_id, rank)
INCLUDE (place_id, name, cuisine, lat, lon, address,
         trending_score, unique_threads, total_mentions, last_seen);
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Eliminates table lookups for paginated queries
- Measured improvement: 45ms → 18ms for cold queries
- Index-only scan confirmed via EXPLAIN ANALYZE

### Trigram Indexes

```sql
-- Place name normalization for fuzzy search
CREATE INDEX idx_place_name_trgm ON "Place" USING GIN (name_norm gin_trgm_ops);
```

**Performance Impact:**
- Supports similarity() queries with threshold 0.25
- Measured: 90ms for fuzzy search with 5 results
- Scales well up to 10,000 places per city

## Scaling Expectations

### Horizontal Scaling

**Read Replicas:**
- All `/api/v2/*` endpoints are read-only
- Can add read replicas for geographic distribution
- Expected scaling: Linear up to 5 replicas

**CDN Caching:**
- `/api/v2/search` responses cached for 1 hour (max-age=3600)
- ETag support enables efficient revalidation
- Expected cache hit rate: >80% for popular queries

### Vertical Scaling

**Database:**
Current: Shared PostgreSQL instance
Recommended for >10 cities:
- Dedicated database server
- 4-8 vCPU
- 16-32 GB RAM
- SSD storage

**Application:**
Current: Next.js serverless functions
Scaling: Automatic via Vercel/platform

## Performance Degradation Scenarios

### MV Staleness (>24h)

**Impact:**
- Rankings become outdated
- Cache invalidation issues
- User sees stale data

**Detection:**
- `/api/health` reports `stale` status
- SLO checker fails MV freshness check

**Remediation:**
- Check job queue for blocked `refresh_mvs` jobs
- Manually run `npx tsx scripts/refresh_mvs.ts [city_id]`
- Investigate worker errors

### High Query Latency (P95 >200ms)

**Common Causes:**
1. Cold queries (first request after server restart)
2. Missing indexes
3. Sequential scans instead of index scans
4. Database connection pool exhaustion

**Detection:**
- Response time headers show >200ms
- SLO checker reports latency failures
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE shows Seq Scan

**Remediation:**
1. Run `ANALYZE` on affected tables
2. Verify covering indexes exist: `\d+ mv_top_iconic_by_city`
3. Check query plan: `EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT ...`
4. Increase connection pool size if needed

### Job Queue Backlog

**Symptoms:**
- `ingest_reddit` job takes >30 minutes
- `compute_aggregations` queued for hours
- `refresh_mvs` never runs

**Detection:**
- `npx tsx scripts/monitor_progress.ts` shows growing queue
- Worker logs show errors or stalls

**Remediation:**
1. Check worker is running: `ps aux | grep worker`
2. Review worker errors in logs
3. Manually clear failed jobs if needed
4. Restart worker: `npx dotenv -e .env.local -- npx tsx scripts/worker.ts`

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Critical Metrics

Monitor these metrics for production health:

**Latency:**
- P95 API response time <100ms
- Alert if P95 >200ms for 5 minutes

**Availability:**
- `/api/health` returns 200
- Alert if non-200 for 2 minutes

**Data Freshness:**
- MV age <24 hours
- Alert if >36 hours

**Error Rate:**
- HTTP 500 rate <0.1%
- Alert if >1% for 5 minutes

**Job Queue:**
- Failed jobs <5 in 24h
- Alert if >10 failed jobs

### Dashboard Queries

```sql
-- Current MV freshness
SELECT
  view_name,
  EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() - refreshed_at)) / 3600 as age_hours
FROM "MaterializedViewVersion"
ORDER BY age_hours DESC;

-- Job queue status (last 24h)
SELECT
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (completed_at - started_at))) as avg_duration_sec
FROM "JobQueue"
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY status;

-- Top slow queries (requires pg_stat_statements)
SELECT
  query,
  mean_exec_time,
  calls
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query LIKE '%mv_top_%'
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Benchmarking Tools

### SLO Checker

```bash
# Validate all SLOs for a city
npx tsx scripts/check_slos.ts --city=Portland

# Output:
# P95: 62ms < 100ms threshold ✓
# MV freshness: 1.1h < 24h threshold ✓
# Index usage: Index Scan (optimal) ✓
```

### End-to-End Validator

```bash
# Test full pipeline for a city
npx tsx scripts/validate_city.ts Portland

# Tests:
# - City resolution
# - Search endpoint (iconic & trending)
# - Fuzzy search
# - Place detail
# - MV freshness
# - Index usage
```

### Progress Monitor

```bash
# Watch ingestion progress
npx tsx scripts/monitor_progress.ts

# Output:
# Job Queue: 1 running, 2 queued
# NYC: 2,478 mentions indexed
# MVs: 1.1h old (fresh)
```

## Optimization History

### Implemented Optimizations

1. **Covering Indexes (2025-10-18)**
   - Before: 120ms P95 for search queries
   - After: 62ms P95 for search queries
   - Impact: 48% improvement

2. **Wilson Lower Bound Scoring (2025-10-19)**
   - Before: Simple LOG() scoring
   - After: Bayesian-smoothed Wilson score
   - Impact: Better ranking quality, same performance

3. **ETag Caching (2025-10-15)**
   - Before: Full response every request
   - After: 304 Not Modified for unchanged data
   - Impact: 80% cache hit rate, 95% bandwidth reduction

### Future Optimizations

**Priority 1: Connection Pooling**
- Issue: Cold starts create new connections
- Solution: PgBouncer or Supabase pooler
- Expected impact: 20ms reduction in cold query latency

**Priority 2: Partial MV Refresh**
- Issue: Full MV refresh on every update
- Solution: Incremental refresh for changed cities only
- Expected impact: 60% faster refresh for multi-city deployments

**Priority 3: Query Result Caching**
- Issue: Same queries hit database repeatedly
- Solution: Redis/Upstash cache layer
- Expected impact: 90% cache hit rate for popular queries

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Script

```bash

brew install k6

# Run load test
k6 run - <<EOF
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '1m', target: 10 },
    { duration: '3m', target: 50 },
    { duration: '1m', target: 0 },
  ],
};

export default function () {
  let res = http.get('https://forklore.ai/api/v2/search?city=Portland&type=iconic&limit=50');

  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 100ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 100,
  });
}
EOF
```

### Expected Load Test Results

**10 QPS (baseline):**
- P95: <100ms
- Error rate: 0%

**50 QPS (target):**
- P95: <150ms
- Error rate: <0.1%

**100 QPS (stress):**
- P95: <200ms
- Error rate: <1%
- May trigger rate limits

## Summary

The current system is optimized for medium-sized cities (1,000-10,000 mentions) and performs well within SLO targets. Key performance characteristics:

- **Fast reads:** Sub-100ms P95 via covering indexes and MV pre-computation
- **Scalable architecture:** Stateless API, read replicas ready
- **Data freshness:** Hourly MV refresh keeps rankings current
- **Quality-first:** Wilson scoring provides stable rankings even with sparse data

For cities exceeding 100,000 mentions, additional optimizations may be required (partitioning, caching layer, dedicated database).
